    <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
    <p>Perfume is a <span>fragrant liquid</span> mixture used to create a pleasant scent, typically applied to the body or objects.
     It's made of fragrant essential oils, either <span>natural or synthetic</span>, combined with fixatives and solvents. Perfumes 
     are used to impart a <span>pleasing aroma</span> to the wearer and their surroundings. Here's a more detailed look:Ingredients:
     Perfume is a blend of <span>fragrant oils</span>, fixatives (which help the scent last), and solvents (usually alcohol).
     Sources of Scents:Natural scents can be derived from plants <span>(herbs, flowers, fruits, etc.)</span>, animals, or synthetic 
     chemical compounds.Perfume types reflect the <span>concentration of aromatic compounds</span> in a solvent, which in fine fragrance
      is typically ethanol or a mix of water and <span>ethanol</span>. Various sources differ considerably in their definitions of perfume types.
     <span>The intensity and longevity</span> of a fragrance are based on the concentration, intensity, and <span>longevity of the aromatic compounds,
     or perfume oils</span>, used. As the percentage of aromatic compounds increases, so does the intensity and longevity of the scent.
     Specific terms are used to describe a fragrance's approximate concentration by the percent of perfume oil in the volume of
    the final product.<span>Ancient texts and archaeological excavation</span>s show the use of perfumes in some of the earliest human
    civilizations. <span>Modern perfumery</span> began in the late <span>19th century</span> with the commercial synthesis of aroma compounds such 
    as <span>vanillin or coumarin</span>, which allowed for the composition of perfumes with smells previously unattainable solely from
    <span>natural aromatics</span>.Furthermore, some fragrances with the same product name but having a different concentration may not
    only differ in their dilutions but actually use different perfume oil mixtures altogether. For instance, in order to
    make the EdT version of a fragrance brighter and fresher than its <span>EdP, the EdT oil may be "tweaked"</span> to contain slightly
    more.
